## Investigating the Most Effective Card-Upgrade Strategy in Clash Royale

This summer I had the privilege to work with Dr. Ivan Ramler on a statistics-based project inspired by Clash Royale. It is a real-time strategy video game that allows two players to “battle” with their decks - a combination of eight cards, each associated with a level that can be increased through upgrades. Our goal is to investigate the most effective card-upgrade strategy across different decks while also taking into account the in-game currency required for upgrades.

These are the folders within this repository:

* Modeling_RSciprts_Stage_1: All files created in the modeling process in the first stage.
* Modeling_RSciprts_Stage_2: The modeling files in the second stage, exeucted on a High Performance Compute Cluster.
* Data_Processed_Stage_1: The data processed from Modeling_RSciprts_Stage_1 files.
* Data_Processed_Stage_2: Data and models returned from Modeling_RSciprts_Stage_2 files. Only a portion of them are here - the rest are extremely large.
* End_Stage_Updates: Updates for the model for Seasons 14+.
* Shiny: Every version of the Shiny app developed over the course of our research. Shiny_Mod3_Hybrid_V2_S21 is the final version.
